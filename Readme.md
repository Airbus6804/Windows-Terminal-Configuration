### This is my personal Windows Terminal Configuration with acrylic and transparency

![Windows Terminal Preview Image](https://github.com/Airbus6804/Windows-Terminal-Configuration/blob/master/preview.png?raw=true)

In order to use this you need to have [windows terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0dx20hk701?hl=it-it&gl=IT) installed on your machine

## Installation

1. Clone the repo and cd into it
2. Open terminal inside the folder !!!Important: Do not use Powershell as it will throw an error, use CMD instead
3. Run "./apply_conf.bat" this will copy the settings.json file inside your Windows Terminal configuration file
4. Restart Windows Terminal
